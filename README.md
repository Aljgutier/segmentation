* Evolution of direct, data and digital marketing, Richard Webber, Journal of Direct, Data and Digital Marketing Practice (2013) 14, 291â€“309.  
* DM becomes business as usual. As a result of the rise of multi-channel operations, it has become increasingly difficult for DM to separate itself out as a distinct business philosophy. 
* The internet also provides an alternative way of undertaking market research surveys. Of increasing importance in large organizations is the linkage of information from customer surveys with information held on a typical CRM database. 
* The skills required to access, manipulate and interpret digital footprints from these new channels is a specialist activity currently largely disconnected from the experience of DM professionals. 
* The web has transformed DM in numerous ways. The principal one of these is that it provides a much lower-cost channel both for the communication of content and for order processing than previous communications channels.
* The need to achieve acceptable returns from this investment motivates Direct Marketers to invest in specialist skills for maximizing page rankings, customer stickiness and click-through conversion.

* The popular RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis method is used for data reduction.
* The EFTPOS data for this research has been periodically
extracted from the operational environment of the bank by their
data warehouse team. 
* A natural progression of this work is on finding ways to optimize
the Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) algorithm for
Big Data through parallelisation. Splitting the data set into two
subsets like what we have done in this paper is obviously not
scalable.
* The preliminary work reported in this paper only uses 18 days of
EFTPOS data. To date, we have been accumulating months of the
EFTPOS data which makes this project a truly challenging Big
Data problem with respect to the volume of data to be processed
and analysed.
* The bottleneck in the AHC algorithm is in the calculations of the
distance metric between data points to build the distance matrix
and to update it upon the creation of a new cluster. Time saving
can be achieved by parallelisation of this part of the algorithm,

**Department Store Regional Activity**  
* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjeetsingh/retaildataset  
* Contains additional data related to the store, department, and regional activity for the given dates.
* The Challenge - One challenge of modeling retail data is the need to make decisions based on limited history. Holidays and select major events come once a year, and so does the chance to see how strategic decisions impacted the bottom line. In addition, markdowns are known to affect sales – the challenge is to predict which departments will be affected and to what extent
* You are provided with historical sales data for 45 stores located in different regions - each store contains a number of departments. The company also runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of which are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks.
